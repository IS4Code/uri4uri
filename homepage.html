<p>uri4uri provides resolvable URIs to represent any URI. This is a major breakthrough in how the web works. This service will enable a raft of advances in web technology. Our database contains many useful facts about <i>every</i> URI.</p>
<form>
Enter any URI:
<input style='border-radius:5px' name='uri' id='uri' /> 
</form>
<div id='result'></div>
</div>
<h3>How does it work?</h3>
<p>For the past 3 years our server farm has been working to caculate every possible URI, including web addresses, email addresses, ISBNs and even gopher! This has been a massive undertaking and would not have been possible even five years ago. The data store is intensely indexed so that the information can be retrieved virtually instantly. Ensuring excellent response times has been at the core of everything we do.</p>

<h3>How big is it?</h3>
<p>The complete database contains information on literally trillions of URIs. Each record is several kilobytes so the size is astronomical. Currently it stands at 5.7 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exabyte">Exabytes</a> and is growing by appoximately 3% per month. However, we use a combination of aggressive and pro-active compession techniques which reduce the total footprint to a much more manageable 78 <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petabyte'>Petabytes</a>.</p>

<p>What we can confidently state, is that this is the largest and most linked dataset in history. It dwarfs any other dataset in the <a href='http://lod-cloud.net/'>web of data</a>.</p>
