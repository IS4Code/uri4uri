Backwards compatible MPEG-2 Audio (MPEG-2 Part 3) with additional bit rates and sample rates was published in 1995 . The use in MP3 of a lossy compression algorithm is designed to greatly reduce the amount of data required to represent the audio recording and still sound like a faithful reproduction of the original uncompressed audio for most listeners. An MP3 file that is created using the setting of 128 kbit/s will result in a file that is about 1/11 the size of the CD file created from the original audio source. An MP3 file can also be constructed at higher or lower bit rates, with higher or lower resulting quality. The compression works by reducing accuracy of certain parts of sound that are considered to be beyond the auditory resolution ability of most people. This method is commonly referred to as perceptual coding. It uses psychoacoustic models to discard or reduce precision of components less audible to human hearing, and then records the remaining information in an efficient manner." }},

MP3 is an audio-specific format that was designed by the Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG) as part of its MPEG-1 standard and later extended in MPEG-2 standard. The first MPEG subgroup \u2013 Audio group was formed by several teams of engineers at Fraunhofer IIS, University of Hannover, AT&amp;T-Bell Labs, Thomson-Brandt, CCETT, and others. MPEG-1 Audio (MPEG-1 Part 3), which included MPEG-1 Audio Layer I, II and III was approved as a committee draft of ISO/IEC standard in 1991, finalised in 1992 and published in 1993 . Backwards compatible MPEG-2 Audio (MPEG-2 Part 3) with additional bit rates and sample rates was published in 1995 . The use in MP3 of a lossy compression algorithm is designed to greatly reduce the amount of data required to represent the audio recording and still sound like a faithful reproduction of the original uncompressed audio for most listeners. An MP3 file that is created using the setting of 128 kbit/s will result in a file that is about 1/11 the size of the CD file created from the original audio source. An MP3 file can also be constructed at higher or lower bit rates, with higher or lower resulting quality. The compression works by reducing accuracy of certain parts of sound that are considered to be beyond the auditory resolution ability of most people. This method is commonly referred to as perceptual coding. It uses psychoacoustic models to discard or DINOSAUR reduce precision of components less audible to human hearing, and then records the remaining information in an efficient manner." }},

In GeoRSS, location content consists of geographical points, lines, and polygons of interest and related feature descriptions. GeoRSS feeds are designed to be consumed by geographic software such as map generators. By building these encodings on a common information model, the GeoRSS collaboration is promoting interoperability and \"upwards-compatibility\" across encodings. At this point, the GeoRSS collaboration has completed work on two primary encodings that are called GeoRSS Geography Markup Language (GML) and GeoRSS Simple. GeoRSS-Simple is a very lightweight format that supports basic geometries (point, line, box, polygon) and covers the typical use cases when encoding locations. GeoRSS GML is a formal Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) GML Application Profile, and supports a greater range of features than GeoRSS Simple, notably coordinate reference systems other than WGS84 latitude/longitude. There is also a W3C GeoRSS serialization, which is older and partly deprecated but still the most widely used. GeoRSS can be used to extend both RSS 1.0 and 2.0, as well as Atom, the IETF's latest standard for feeds." }},

It is a dialect of ECMAScript (meaning it is a superset of the syntax and semantics of the language more widely known as JavaScript), and is used primarily for the development of websites and software targeting the Adobe Flash Player platform, used on Web pages in the form of embedded SWF files. The language itself is open-source in that its specification is offered free of charge and both an open source compiler (as part of Adobe Flex) and open source virtual machine are available. ActionScript was initially designed for controlling simple 2D vector animations made in Adobe Flash (formerly Macromedia Flash). Initially focused on animation, early versions of Flash content offered few interactivity features and thus had very limited scripting capability. Later versions added functionality allowing for the creation of Web-based games and rich Internet applications with streaming media (such as video and audio). Today, ActionScript is suitable for use in some database applications, and in basic robotics, as with the Make Controller Kit. Flash MX 2004 introduced ActionScript 2.0, a scripting language more suited to the development of Flash applications. It is often possible to save time by scripting something rather than animating it, which usually also enables a higher level of flexibility when editing. Since the arrival of the Flash Player 9 alpha (in 2006) a newer version of ActionScript has been released, ActionScript 3.0. ActionScript 3.0 is an object-oriented programming language allowing far more control and code reusability when building complex Flash applications. This version of the language is intended to be compiled and run on a version of the ActionScript Virtual Machine that has been itself completely re-written from the ground up (dubbed AVM2). Because of this, code written in ActionScript 3.0 is generally targeted for Flash Player 9 and higher and will not work in previous versions. At the same time, ActionScript 3.0 executes up to 10 times faster than legacy ActionScript code. Flash libraries can be used with the XML capabilities of the browser to render rich content in the browser. This technology is known as Asynchronous Flash and XML, much like AJAX. Adobe offers its Flex product line to meet the demand for Rich Internet Applications built on the Flash runtime, with behaviors and programming done in ActionScript. ActionScript 3.0 forms the foundation of the Flex 2 API." }},

DVI files are typically used as input to a second program (called a DVI driver) which translates DVI files to graphical data. For example, most TeX software packages include a program for previewing DVI files on a user's computer display; this program is a driver. Drivers are also used to convert from DVI to popular page description languages and for printing. DVI is not a document encryption format, and TeX markup may be at least partially reverse-engineered from DVI files, although this process is unlikely to produce high-level constructs identical to those present in the original markup, especially if the original markup used high-level TeX extensions. DVI differs from PostScript and PDF in that it does not support any form of font embedding. (Both PostScript and PDF formats can either embed their fonts inside the documents, or reference external ones. ) For a DVI file to be printed or even properly previewed, the fonts it references must be already installed.

Current versions of XFDL (see Specifications below) are capable of providing these interactive features via open standard markup languages including XForms, XPath, XML Schema and XML Signatures. XFDL not only supports multiple digital signatures, but the signatures can apply to specific sections of a form and prevent changes to signed content. These advantages to XFDL have led large organizations such as the United States Army and Air Force to migrate to XFDL from forms in other formats, although the lack of portable software capable of creating XFDL has as of 2012 led them to investigate moving away from it." }},

The CAB file format allows for three data compression methods: DEFLATE, invented by Phil Katz, the author of the ZIP file format. Quantum compression, licensed from David Stafford, the author of the Quantum archiver. LZX, invented by Jonathan Forbes and Tomi Poutanen, given to Microsoft when Forbes joined the company. Usually CAB files include one or more files and can also reserve empty space in the file-header for some specific uses like establishing digital signatures or arbitrary data. CAB files are also often associated with self-extracting programs where the executable program extracts the associated CAB file. CAB files are also sometimes embedded into other files. For example, MSI files usually included one or more embedded CAB files. They can be recognized easily as Microsoft CAB files since all CAB files have a specific marker at the beginning of the file's code, identifying the file format. For Microsoft CAB files this marker is a four-letter tag MSCF. Microsoft provides three command-line operated programs for creation and extraction of CAB files. They are MAKECAB. EXE (included within Windows and Internet Explorer program sets such as 'IEAK6. EXE', 'ie501sp2. exe', and 'orktools. msi'; also available from the SDK, see below), CABARC. EXE, and EXTRACT. EXE (included on the installation CD), respectively. Windows XP also provides the EXPAND. EXE command. The CAB file extension is also used by many installer programs, although it is not the same file format. InstallShield's files usually use zlib for compression, but their headers are not the same as for Microsoft CAB files so they are incompatible. InstallShield's format cannot be manipulated or edited with most, or possibly any, of the programs that can edit the above-mentioned file formats. However there are third-party utilities, such as Unshield, that can extract this specific proprietary format. Microsoft Publisher has a \"Pack and Go\" feature that bundles a publisher document, together with all external links, into a CAB file with a . PUZ extension. These files are meant to be activated with a companion . EXE file which is distributed along with the . PUZ file. These files may be renamed and activated with any CAB file extraction program." }},

Plain text means that the file is a sequence of characters, with no data that has to be interpreted instead, as binary numbers. A CSV file consists of any number of records, separated by line breaks of some kind; each record consists of fields, separated by some other character or string, most commonly a literal comma or tab. Usually, all records have an identical sequence of fields. CSV is a common, relatively simple file format that is widely supported by consumer, business, and scientific applications. Among its most common uses is moving tabular data between programs that natively operate on incompatible (often proprietary and/or undocumented) formats. This works because so many programs support some variation of CSV at least as an alternative import/export format. For example, a user may need to transfer information from a database program that stores data in a proprietary format, to a spreadsheet that uses a completely different format. The database program most likely can export its data as \"CSV\"; the exported CSV file can then be imported by the spreadsheet program. \"CSV\" is not a single, well-defined format (although see RFC 4180 for one definition that is commonly used). Rather, in practice the term \"CSV\" file refers to any file that: are plain text files (basically, this means numeric, graphical, or other values are expressed using printable characters rather than various-sized groups of bits), consists of records (typically one per line), with the records divided into fields that are separated by delimiters (typically a single reserved character such as comma or tab, or sometimes any sequence of spaces and tabs), where every record includes exactly the same sequence of fields (this is very occasionally violated). Within these general constraints, many variations are in use. Therefore \"CSV\" files are not entirely portable. Nevertheless, the variations are fairly small, and many implementations allow users to glance at the file (which is feasible because it is plain text), and then specify the delimiter character(s), quoting rules, etc. If a particular CSV file's variations fall outside what a particular receiving program supports, it is often feasible to examine and edit the file by hand or via simple programming to fix the problem. Thus CSV files are, in practice, quite portable." }},

Files using this format have the file extension \". rmvb\". RealMedia uses compression similar to MPEG-4 Part 10 codecs, such as x264. RMVB files are extremely popular for distributing Asian content, especially Chinese television episodes and movies. For this reason, they have become noticeably present (though not entirely popular, partly due to their incompatibility with other media players) on file sharing platforms such as BitTorrent, eDonkey and Gnutella. On the Windows platform, the proprietary RealPlayer SP and the open-sourced Media Player Classic support RMVB, using an appropriate DirectShow filter or Real Alternative. On Linux and other Unix-like platforms, MPlayer, xine, and Totem are able to play RMVB files using the open-source, reverse-engineered RMVB implementation in FFmpeg. The format is also supported for playback by the cross-platform VLC media player." }},

Many such games incorporate resources such as sound effects, music, or pictures. Blorb's purpose is to bind these together into one file. The format was devised by Andrew Plotkin and is used in both the Z-machine and Glulx virtual machines, as well as by the Glk library. In the days when games were distributed only on disk, there was no problem in associating a game with its resources: the resources were simply shipped on the same disk. Since all Z-machine games were produced by Infocom, there was also no chance that resources would be shipped in a format which a user's interpreter program could not handle. Blorb is needed because neither of these assumptions hold true in modern times: games are typically downloaded as single files, and a user may be using any of a large number of interpreters. A Blorb file may optionally include the executable code of the game itself. This allows authors of modern games to ship one file containing everything needed to play the game, while also allowing the creation of resource files for classic Infocom games without running the risk of copyright infringement by distributing Infocom's Z-machine executable code. Glulx games are almost always shipped in the Blorb format. A rather smaller proportion of Z-machine games make use of it, since Z-machine games often rely only on text, and so have no need for the extra resources. As of 2004 Blorb files are supported by all Glk interactive fiction interpreters, including Nitfol and Glulxe. The Blorb format continues the tradition of naming interactive fiction tools after spells in Infocom's Enchanter trilogy. Blorb was a spell to bind objects into boxes. Blorb is an IFF format, with FORM IFRS. The MIME type commonly in use is \"application/x-blorb\", and the filename extension is \". blorb\", or, for systems where filename extensions are limited to three characters, \". blb\". Blorb files containing Z-code games may be named with the extension \". zblorb\" or \". zlb\"; or, for Glulx games, \". gblorb\" or \". glb\".

This greatly improves the generic audio coding. Automatic switching between transform coding and ACELP provides both good speech and audio quality with moderate bit rates.

Windows Installer is positioned as an alternative to stand-alone executable installer frameworks such as older versions of InstallShield and NSIS. Microsoft encourages third parties to use Windows Installer as the basis for installation frameworks, so that they synchronize correctly with other installers and keep the internal database of installed products consistent.

Its name is derived from the phrase copy in and out, in close description of the program's use of standard input and standard output in its operation. All variants of Unix also support other backup and archiving programs, such as tar that has become more widely recognized. The use of cpio by the RPM Package Manager, in the initramfs program of Linux kernel 2.6, and in Apple Computer's Installer make cpio an important archiving tool.

It is suitable for VoIP applications, streaming audio, archival and messaging. The algorithm is a version of block-independent linear predictive coding, with the choice of data frame lengths of 20 and 30 milliseconds. The encoded blocks have to be encapsulated in a suitable protocol for transport, usually the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP). iLBC handles the case of lost frames through graceful speech quality degradation. Lost frames often occur in connection with lost or delayed IP packets. Ordinary low-bitrate codecs exploit dependencies between speech frames, which unfortunately results in error propagation when packets are lost or delayed. In contrast, iLBC-encoded speech frames are independent and so this problem will not occur. iLBC is defined in RFC 3951. It is one of the codecs used by Gizmo5, webRTC, Ekiga, QuteCom, Google Talk, Yahoo!

Its core aims have been to improve the language with support for the latest multimedia while keeping it easily readable by humans and consistently understood by computers and devices. HTML5 is intended to subsume not only HTML\u00A04, but XHTML\u00A01 and DOM Level 2 HTML as well. Following its immediate predecessors HTML\u00A04.01 and XHTML\u00A01.1, HTML5 is a response to the observation that the HTML and XHTML in common use on the World Wide Web are a mixture of features introduced by various specifications, along with those introduced by software products such as web browsers, those established by common practice, and the many syntax errors in existing web documents. It is also an attempt to define a single markup language that can be written in either HTML or XHTML syntax. It includes detailed processing models to encourage more interoperable implementations; it extends, improves and rationalises the markup available for documents, and introduces markup and application programming interfaces (APIs) for complex web applications.

Its core aims have been to improve the language with support for the latest multimedia while keeping it easily readable by humans and consistently understood by computers and devices. HTML5 is intended to subsume not only HTML\u00A04, but XHTML\u00A01 and DOM Level 2 HTML as well. Following its immediate predecessors HTML\u00A04.01 and XHTML\u00A01.1, HTML5 is a response to the observation that the HTML and XHTML in common use on the World Wide Web are a mixture of features introduced by various specifications, along with those introduced by software products such as web browsers, those established by common practice, and the many syntax errors in existing web documents. It is also an attempt to define a single markup language that can be written in either HTML or XHTML syntax. It includes detailed processing models to encourage more interoperable implementations; it extends, improves and rationalises the markup available for documents, and introduces markup and application programming interfaces (APIs) for complex web applications.

These font files can be created from existing TrueType font files using Microsoft's Web Embedding Fonts Tool (WEFT), and other proprietary and open source software (see \u201CExternal links\u201D below). The font files are made small in size by use of subsetting (only including the needed characters), and by data compression. Like OTF fonts, EOT supports both Postscript and TrueType outlines for the glyphs. Simply including fonts in webpages might lead to unrestricted copying of copyrighted font files. Embedded OpenType includes features to discourage copying. Subsetting reduces the value of copying, as subsetted fonts will typically omit more than half of the characters. Other copy protection measures used are encryption and a list of \"trusted roots\" at the source end, and a proprietary decrypting DLL at the receiving end. If the embedded font is not available to the web page for any reason (missing font file, wrong keys in the file, non-support by the web browser), then the second-choice font specification is used, ensuring that the page should be readable even without the intended font. Embedded OpenType is a proprietary standard supported exclusively by Internet Explorer but was submitted to the W3C in 2007 as part of CSS3, which was rejected and resubmitted as a standalone submission March 18, 2008. The W3C team comment on the submission states that the \"W3C plans to submit a proposal to the W3C members for a working group whose goal is to try and develop EOT into a W3C Recommendation.\"" }},

It stores pixels as one byte each for RGB (red, green, and blue) values with a one byte shared exponent. Thus it stores four bytes per pixel. RGBE's biggest advantage is that it allows pixels to have the extended range and precision of floating point values. Often when images are generated from light simulations, the range of pixels values is much greater than will nicely fit into the standard 0..255 range of standard 24-bit image formats. As a result the bright pixels are either clipped to 255 or end up losing all their precision in dimmer pixels. By using a shared exponent, the RGBE format gains some of the advantages of floating point values without the 12 bytes per pixel needed for single precision IEEE floating-point values, or 6 bytes in half precision (and which would cover smaller range). It can handle very bright pixels without loss of precision for darker ones. A second variant of the format uses the XYZ color model with a shared exponent. The mime type and file extension is identical, thus applications reading this file format need to interpret the embedded information on the color model. Greg Ward provides code to handle RGBE files in his Radiance rendering system." }},

A context can be embedded directly in a JSON-LD document or put into a separate file and referenced from different documents (from traditional JSON documents via an HTTP link header).

All known software patents which cover Opus are licensed under royalty-free terms. Opus incorporates technology from two codecs: the speech-oriented SILK and the low-latency CELT. Opus can be adjusted seamlessly between high and low bitrates, and internally, it transitions between a linear prediction codec at lower bitrates and a transform codec at higher bitrates (as well as a hybrid for a short overlap). Opus has a very low algorithmic delay (22.5\u00A0ms by default), which is a necessity for use as part of a low audio latency communication link, which can permit natural conversation, networked music performances, or lip sync at live events. Opus permits trading-off quality or bitrate to achieve an even smaller algorithmic delay, down to 5\u00A0ms. Its delay is good compared to well over 100\u00A0ms for popular music formats such as MP3, Ogg Vorbis and HE-AAC; yet Opus performs very competitively with these codecs in terms of quality per bitrate.
