Although Netscape submitted it to the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), the technology was never accepted as a formal standard and it never gained much acceptance in the market. Only Netscape Communicator 4 supported JSSS, with the rival Internet Explorer web browser choosing not to implement the technology. Soon after Netscape Communicator's release in 1997, Netscape stopped promoting JSSS, instead focusing on the rival CSS standard, which was also supported by Internet Explorer and had much wider industry acceptance. The follow-up to Netscape Communicator, Netscape 6 (released in 2000), dropped support for JSSS. It now remains little more than a historical footnote, with many Web developers not even being aware of its existence. The proposed standard was not finished. Using JavaScript code as a stylesheet, JSSS styles individual element by modifying properties of the document. tags object. For example, the CSS: h1 { font-size: 20pt; } is equivalent to the JSSS: document. tags.H1. fontSize = \"20pt\"; Note the case significance in element names. JSSS is in some ways more powerful and in some ways less powerful than CSS. It lacks the various CSS selector features, supporting only a simple tag name selector. On the other hand, since it is written using a complete programming language, stylesheets can include highly complex dynamic calculations and conditional processing. (In practice, however, this can be achieved with CSS by using JavaScript to modify the stylesheets applicable to the document at runtime. ) Because of this JSSS was often used in the creation of DHTML. Being written in JavaScript, JSSS may seem less friendly than CSS to users without a programming background." }},

Their implementation of edition 5 in the Windows 8 Consumer Preview is called JavaScript. [sic] The primary differences between JScript and JScript . NET can be summarized as follows: Firstly, JScript is a scripting language, and as such programs (or more suggestively, scripts) can be executed without the need to compile the code first. This is not the case with the JScript . NET command-line compiler, since this next-generation version relies on the . NET Common Language Runtime (CLR) for execution, which requires that the code be compiled to Common Intermediate Language (CIL), formerly called Microsoft Intermediate Language (MSIL), code before it can be run. Nevertheless, JScript . NET still provides full support for interpreting code at runtime (e.g. , via the constructor or the function) and indeed the interpreter can be exposed by custom applications hosting the JScript . NET engine via the VSA interfaces. Secondly, JScript has a strong foundation in Microsoft's ActiveX/COM technologies, and relies primarily on ActiveX components to provide much of its functionality (including database access via ADO, file handling etc. ), whereas JScript . NET uses the . NET Framework to provide equivalent functionality. For backwards-compatibility (or for where no . NET equivalent library exists), JScript . NET still provides full access to ActiveX objects via . NET / COM interop using both the ActiveXObject constructor and the standard methods of the . NET Type class. Although the . NET Framework and . NET languages such as C# and Visual Basic . NET have seen widespread adoption, JScript . NET has never received much attention, by the media or by developers. It is not supported in Microsoft's premier development tool, Visual Studio . NET. However, ASP. NET supports JScript . NET." }},

The first tag in a pair is the start tag, the second tag is the end tag (they are also called opening tags and closing tags).

Its core aims have been to improve the language with support for the latest multimedia while keeping it easily readable by humans and consistently understood by computers and devices. HTML5 is intended to subsume not only HTML\u00A04, but XHTML\u00A01 and DOM Level 2 HTML as well. Following its immediate predecessors HTML\u00A04.01 and XHTML\u00A01.1, HTML5 is a response to the observation that the HTML and XHTML in common use on the World Wide Web are a mixture of features introduced by various specifications, along with those introduced by software products such as web browsers, those established by common practice, and the many syntax errors in existing web documents. It is also an attempt to define a single markup language that can be written in either HTML or XHTML syntax. It includes detailed processing models to encourage more interoperable implementations; it extends, improves and rationalises the markup available for documents, and introduces markup and application programming interfaces (APIs) for complex web applications. For the same reasons, HTML5 is also a potential candidate for cross-platform mobile applications. Many features of HTML5 have been built with the consideration of being able to run on low-powered devices such as smartphones and tablets. In December 2011 research firm Strategy Analytics forecast sales of HTML5 compatible phones will top 1 billion in 2013. In particular, HTML5 adds many new syntactical features. These include the new, and elements, as well as the integration of scalable vector graphics (SVG) content that replaces the uses of generic tags and MathML for mathematical formulae. These features are designed to make it easy to include and handle multimedia and graphical content on the web without having to resort to proprietary plugins and APIs. Other new elements, such as,, and, are designed to enrich the semantic content of documents. New attributes have been introduced for the same purpose, while some elements and attributes have been removed. Some elements, such as, and have been changed, redefined or standardized. The APIs and document object model (DOM) are no longer afterthoughts, but are fundamental parts of the HTML5 specification.

In 1993, the 32-bit version of Win32/GDI introduced the Enhanced Metafile (EMF), a newer version with additional commands. EMF is also used as a graphics language for printer drivers.

This is different from the Tagged Image File Format, which is a standard administered by Adobe currently called \"TIFF, Revision 6.0 Final \u2013 June 3, 1992\". The TIFF/EP standard is based on a subset of the Adobe TIFF standard, and a subset of the JEITA Exif standard, with some differences and extensions. One of the uses of TIFF/EP is as a raw image format. A characteristic of most digital cameras (but excluding those using the Foveon X3 sensor or similar, hence especially Sigma cameras) is that they use a color filter array (CFA). Software processing a raw image format for such a camera needs information about the configuration of the color filter array, so that the raw image can identify separate data from the individual sites of the sensor. Ideally this information is held within the raw image file itself, and TIFF/EP uses the tags that begin \"CFA\", CFARepeatPatternDim and CFAPattern, which are only relevant for raw images. This standard has not been adopted by most camera manufacturers \u2013 Exif/DCF is the current industry standard file organisation system which uses the Exchangeable image file format. However, TIFF/EP provided a basis for the raw image formats of a number of cameras. One example is Nikon's NEF raw file format, which uses the tag TIFF/EPStandardID (with value 1.0.0.0). Adobe's DNG (Digital Negative) raw file format was based on TIFF/EP, and the DNG specification states \"DNG ... is compatible with the TIFF-EP standard\". Several cameras use DNG as their raw file format, so in that limited sense they use TIFF/EP too." }},

For example, most TeX software packages include a program for previewing DVI files on a user's computer display; this program is a driver. Drivers are also used to convert from DVI to popular page description languages and for printing.

FITS was designed with an eye towards long-term archival storage, and the maxim once FITS, always FITS represents the requirement that developments to the format must be backwards compatible. A major feature of the FITS format is that image metadata is stored in a human-readable ASCII header, so that an interested user can examine the headers to investigate a file of unknown provenance. Each FITS file consists of one or more headers containing ASCII card images (80 character fixed-length strings) that carry keyword/value pairs, interleaved between data blocks. The keyword/value pairs provide information such as size, origin, coordinates, binary data format, free-form comments, history of the data, and anything else the creator desires: while many keywords are reserved for FITS use, the standard allows arbitrary use of the rest of the name-space. FITS is also often used to store non-image data, such as spectra, photon lists, data cubes, or even structured data such as multi-table databases.

It is used for compression and digital signing by a variety of Microsoft installation programs: Setup API, Device Installer, AdvPack (for the installation of ActiveX components from Internet Explorer) and Windows Installer. Files with extension . CAB are known as \"Cabinet\" files. Cabinet files were known originally as Diamond files. The CAB file format allows for three data compression methods: DEFLATE, invented by Phil Katz, the author of the ZIP file format. Quantum compression, licensed from David Stafford, the author of the Quantum archiver. LZX, invented by Jonathan Forbes and Tomi Poutanen, given to Microsoft when Forbes joined the company. Usually CAB files include one or more files and can also reserve empty space in the file-header for some specific uses like establishing digital signatures or arbitrary data. CAB files are also often associated with self-extracting programs where the executable program extracts the associated CAB file. CAB files are also sometimes embedded into other files. For example, MSI files usually included one or more embedded CAB files. They can be recognized easily as Microsoft CAB files since all CAB files have a specific marker at the beginning of the file's code, identifying the file format. For Microsoft CAB files this marker is a four-letter tag MSCF. Microsoft provides three command-line operated programs for creation and extraction of CAB files. They are MAKECAB. EXE (included within Windows and Internet Explorer program sets such as 'IEAK6. EXE', 'ie501sp2. exe', and 'orktools. msi'; also available from the SDK, see below), CABARC. EXE, and EXTRACT. EXE (included on the installation CD), respectively. Windows XP also provides the EXPAND. EXE command. The CAB file extension is also used by many installer programs, although it is not the same file format. InstallShield's files usually use zlib for compression, but their headers are not the same as for Microsoft CAB files so they are incompatible. InstallShield's format cannot be manipulated or edited with most, or possibly any, of the programs that can edit the above-mentioned file formats. However there are third-party utilities, such as Unshield, that can extract this specific proprietary format. Microsoft Publisher has a \"Pack and Go\" feature that bundles a publisher document, together with all external links, into a CAB file with a . PUZ extension. These files are meant to be activated with a companion . EXE file which is distributed along with the . PUZ file. These files may be renamed and activated with any CAB file extraction program." }},

(now owned by Adobe Systems). It is a dialect of ECMAScript (meaning it is a superset of the syntax and semantics of the language more widely known as JavaScript), and is used primarily for the development of websites and software targeting the Adobe Flash Player platform, used on Web pages in the form of embedded SWF files. The language itself is open-source in that its specification is offered free of charge and both an open source compiler (as part of Adobe Flex) and open source virtual machine are available. ActionScript was initially designed for controlling simple 2D vector animations made in Adobe Flash (formerly Macromedia Flash). Initially focused on animation, early versions of Flash content offered few interactivity features and thus had very limited scripting capability. Later versions added functionality allowing for the creation of Web-based games and rich Internet applications with streaming media (such as video and audio). Today, ActionScript is suitable for use in some database applications, and in basic robotics, as with the Make Controller Kit. Flash MX 2004 introduced ActionScript 2.0, a scripting programming language more suited to the development of Flash applications. It is often possible to save time by scripting something rather than animating it, which usually also enables a higher level of flexibility when editing. Since the arrival of the Flash Player 9 alpha (in 2006) a newer version of ActionScript has been released, ActionScript 3.0. ActionScript 3.0 is an object-oriented programming language allowing far more control and code reusability when building complex Flash applications. This version of the language is intended to be compiled and run on a version of the ActionScript Virtual Machine that has been itself completely re-written from the ground up (dubbed AVM2). Because of this, code written in ActionScript 3.0 is generally targeted for Flash Player 9 and higher and will not work in previous versions. At the same time, ActionScript 3.0 executes up to 10 times faster than legacy ActionScript code. Flash libraries can be used with the XML capabilities of the browser to render rich content in the browser. This technology is known as Asynchronous Flash and XML, much like AJAX. Adobe offers its Flex product line to meet the demand for Rich Internet Applications built on the Flash runtime, with behaviors and programming done in ActionScript. ActionScript 3.0 forms the foundation of the Flex 2 API." }},

Plain text means that the file is a sequence of characters, with no data that has to be interpreted instead, as binary numbers. A CSV file consists of any number of records, separated by line breaks of some kind; each record consists of fields, separated by some other character or string, most commonly a literal comma or tab. Usually, all records have an identical sequence of fields. CSV is a common, relatively simple file format that is widely supported by consumer, business, and scientific applications. Among its most common uses is moving tabular data between programs that natively operate on incompatible (often proprietary and/or undocumented) formats. This works because so many programs support some variation of CSV at least as an alternative import/export format. For example, a user may need to transfer information from a database program that stores data in a proprietary format, to a spreadsheet that uses a completely different format. The database program most likely can export its data as \"CSV\"; the exported CSV file can then be imported by the spreadsheet program. \"CSV\" is not a single, well-defined format (although see RFC 4180 for one definition that is commonly used). Rather, in practice the term \"CSV\" file refers to any file that: are plain text files (basically, this means numeric, graphical, or other values are expressed using printable characters rather than various-sized groups of bits), consists of records (typically one per line), with the records divided into fields that are separated by delimiters (typically a single reserved character such as comma or tab, or sometimes any sequence of spaces and tabs), where every record includes exactly the same sequence of fields (this is very occasionally violated). Within these general constraints, many variations are in use. Therefore \"CSV\" files are not entirely portable. Nevertheless, the variations are fairly small, and many implementations allow users to glance at the file (which is feasible because it is plain text), and then specify the delimiter character(s), quoting rules, etc. If a particular CSV file's variations fall outside what a particular receiving program supports, it is often feasible to examine and edit the file by hand or via simple programming to fix the problem. Thus CSV files are, in practice, quite portable." }},

Because command. com (the command interpreter on MS-DOS) exceeded the 64 KiB limit, Microsoft made MS-DOS decide whether to load a given executable as a . com or an MZ based on this magic number rather than the filename. The MZ DOS executable file is newer than the COM executable format and differs from it. The DOS executable header contains relocation information, which allows multiple segments to be loaded at arbitrary memory addresses, and it supports executables larger than 64 KiB; however, the format still requires relatively low memory limits.

To provide a web feed, a site owner may use specialized software (such as a content management system) that publishes a list (or \"feed\") of recent articles or content in a standardized, machine-readable format.

DjVu has been promoted as an alternative to PDF, promising smaller files than PDF for most scanned documents. The DjVu developers report that color magazine pages compress to 40\u201370\u00A0kB, black and white technical papers compress to 15\u201340\u00A0kB, and ancient manuscripts compress to around 100\u00A0kB; a satisfactory JPEG image typically requires 500\u00A0kB. Like PDF, DjVu can contain an OCR text layer, making it easy to perform copy and paste and text search operations. Free browser plug-ins and desktop viewers from different developers are available from the djvu. org website.

Many such games incorporate resources such as sound effects, music, or pictures. Blorb's purpose is to bind these together into one file. The format was devised by Andrew Plotkin and is used in both the Z-machine and Glulx virtual machines, as well as by the Glk library. In the days when games were distributed only on disk, there was no problem in associating a game with its resources: the resources were simply shipped on the same disk. Since all Z-machine games were produced by Infocom, there was also no chance that resources would be shipped in a format which a user's interpreter program could not handle. Blorb is needed because neither of these assumptions hold true in modern times: games are typically downloaded as single files, and a user may be using any of a large number of interpreters. A Blorb file may optionally include the executable code of the game itself. This allows authors of modern games to ship one file containing everything needed to play the game, while also allowing the creation of resource files for classic Infocom games without running the risk of copyright infringement by distributing Infocom's Z-machine executable code. Glulx games are almost always shipped in the Blorb format. A rather smaller proportion of Z-machine games make use of it, since Z-machine games often rely only on text, and so have no need for the extra resources. As of 2004 Blorb files are supported by all Glk interactive fiction interpreters, including Nitfol and Glulxe. The Blorb format continues the tradition of naming interactive fiction tools after spells in Infocom's Enchanter trilogy. Blorb was a spell to bind objects into boxes. Blorb is an IFF format, with FORM IFRS. The MIME type commonly in use is \"application/x-blorb\", and the filename extension is \". blorb\", or, for systems where filename extensions are limited to three characters, \". blb\".

One use of XBRL is to define and exchange financial information, such as a financial statement. The XBRL Specification is developed and published by XBRL International, Inc. (XII). XBRL is a standards-based way to communicate and exchange business information between business systems. These communications are defined by metadata set out in XBRL taxonomies, which capture the definition of individual reporting concepts as well as the relationships between concepts and other semantic meaning. Information being communicated or exchanged is provided within an XBRL instance. Early users of XBRL included regulators such as the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Committee of European Banking Supervisors (CEBS). Common functions in many countries that make use of XBRL include regulators of stock exchanges and securities, banking regulators, business registrars, revenue reporting and tax-filing agencies, and national statistical agencies. A wiki repository of XBRL projects is available to be freely explored and updated. An XBRL Adoption Survey is available as well. According to the FT \"the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the US, the UK\u2019s HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC), and Companies House in Singapore have begun to require companies to use it, and other regulators are following suit.\". The SEC's deployment was launched in 2010 in phases, with the largest filers going first: by 2013, the large foreign companies which use International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) will also be submitting their financial returns to the SEC using XBRL.

All variants of Unix also support other backup and archiving programs, such as tar that has become more widely recognized. The use of cpio by the RPM Package Manager, in the initramfs program of Linux kernel 2.6, and in Apple Computer's Installer make cpio an important archiving tool.

It is suitable for VoIP applications, streaming audio, archival and messaging. The algorithm is a version of block-independent linear predictive coding, with the choice of data frame lengths of 20 and 30 milliseconds. The encoded blocks have to be encapsulated in a suitable protocol for transport, usually the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP). iLBC handles the case of lost frames through graceful speech quality degradation. Lost frames often occur in connection with lost or delayed IP packets. Ordinary low-bitrate codecs exploit dependencies between speech frames, which unfortunately results in error propagation when packets are lost or delayed. In contrast, iLBC-encoded speech frames are independent and so this problem will not occur. iLBC is defined in RFC 3951. It is one of the codecs used by Gizmo5, webRTC, Ekiga, QuteCom, Google Talk, Yahoo! Messenger, Polycom IP Phone and Maemo Recorder and many others. iLBC was submitted to IETF in 2002 and the final specification was published in 2004." }},

Raw files are so named because they are not yet processed and therefore are not ready to be printed or edited with a bitmap graphics editor. Normally, the image is processed by a raw converter in a wide-gamut internal colorspace where precise adjustments can be made before conversion to a \"positive\" file format such as TIFF or JPEG for storage, printing, or further manipulation, which often encodes the image in a device-dependent colorspace. There are dozens if not hundreds of raw formats in use by different models of digital equipment (like cameras or film scanners). Raw image files are sometimes called digital negatives, as they fulfill the same role as negatives in film photography: that is, the negative is not directly usable as an image, but has all of the information needed to create an image. Likewise, the process of converting a raw image file into a viewable format is sometimes called developing a raw image, by analogy with the film development process used to convert photographic film into viewable prints.

Its most common application is to style web pages written in HTML and XHTML, but the language can also be applied to any kind of XML document, including plain XML, SVG and XUL. CSS is designed primarily to enable the separation of document content (written in HTML or a similar markup language) from document presentation, including elements such as the layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple pages to share formatting, and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content (such as by allowing for tableless web design). CSS can also allow the same markup page to be presented in different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (when read out by a speech-based browser or screen reader) and on Braille-based, tactile devices. It can also be used to allow the web page to display differently depending on the screen size or device on which it is being viewed. While the author of a document typically links that document to a CSS style sheet, readers can use a different style sheet, perhaps one on their own computer, to override the one the author has specified. CSS specifies a priority scheme to determine which style rules apply if more than one rule matches against a particular element. In this so-called cascade, priorities or weights are calculated and assigned to rules, so that the results are predictable. The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Internet media type is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998)." }},

Like OTF fonts, EOT supports both Postscript and TrueType outlines for the glyphs. Simply including fonts in webpages might lead to unrestricted copying of copyrighted font files. Embedded OpenType includes features to discourage copying. Subsetting reduces the value of copying, as subsetted fonts will typically omit more than half of the characters. Other copy protection measures used are encryption and a list of \"trusted roots\" at the source end, and a proprietary decrypting DLL at the receiving end. If the embedded font is not available to the web page for any reason (missing font file, wrong keys in the file, non-support by the web browser), then the second-choice font specification is used, ensuring that the page should be readable even without the intended font.

Its core aims have been to improve the language with support for the latest multimedia while keeping it easily readable by humans and consistently understood by computers and devices. HTML5 is intended to subsume not only HTML\u00A04, but XHTML\u00A01 and DOM Level 2 HTML as well. Following its immediate predecessors HTML\u00A04.01 and XHTML\u00A01.1, HTML5 is a response to the observation that the HTML and XHTML in common use on the World Wide Web are a mixture of features introduced by various specifications, along with those introduced by software products such as web browsers, those established by common practice, and the many syntax errors in existing web documents. It is also an attempt to define a single markup language that can be written in either HTML or XHTML syntax. It includes detailed processing models to encourage more interoperable implementations; it extends, improves and rationalises the markup available for documents, and introduces markup and application programming interfaces (APIs) for complex web applications. For the same reasons, HTML5 is also a potential candidate for cross-platform mobile applications. Many features of HTML5 have been built with the consideration of being able to run on low-powered devices such as smartphones and tablets. In December 2011 research firm Strategy Analytics forecast sales of HTML5 compatible phones will top 1 billion in 2013. In particular, HTML5 adds many new syntactical features. These include the new, and elements, as well as the integration of scalable vector graphics (SVG) content that replaces the uses of generic tags and MathML for mathematical formulae. These features are designed to make it easy to include and handle multimedia and graphical content on the web without having to resort to proprietary plugins and APIs. Other new elements, such as,, and, are designed to enrich the semantic content of documents. New attributes have been introduced for the same purpose, while some elements and attributes have been removed. Some elements, such as, and have been changed, redefined or standardized. The APIs and document object model (DOM) are no longer afterthoughts, but are fundamental parts of the HTML5 specification. HTML5 also defines in some detail the required processing for invalid documents so that syntax errors will be treated uniformly by all conforming browsers and other user agents." }},

It stores pixels as one byte each for RGB (red, green, and blue) values with a one byte shared exponent. Thus it stores four bytes per pixel. RGBE's biggest advantage is that it allows pixels to have the extended range and precision of floating point values. Often when images are generated from light simulations, the range of pixels values is much greater than will nicely fit into the standard 0..255 range of standard 24-bit image formats. As a result the bright pixels are either clipped to 255 or end up losing all their precision in dimmer pixels. By using a shared exponent, the RGBE format gains some of the advantages of floating point values without the 12 bytes per pixel needed for single precision IEEE floating-point values, or 6 bytes in half precision (and which would cover smaller range). It can handle very bright pixels without loss of precision for darker ones. A second variant of the format uses the XYZ color model with a shared exponent. The mime type and file extension is identical, thus applications reading this file format need to interpret the embedded information on the color model. Greg Ward provides code to handle RGBE files in his Radiance rendering system." }},

Additionally, SXML is not only a straightforward textual notation for XML data, but also has a directly-corresponding primary data structure for the LISP family of functional programming languages, thus providing an illustrative approach for processing XML data with a general-purpose programming language. Similarity between XML and S-expressions reified in SXML allows achieving close integration between XML data and programming language expressions, resulting in illustrativeness and simplicity of XML data processing for an application programmer.

Encrypted sparse image files are used to secure a user's home directory by the FileVault feature in Mac OS X Snow Leopard and earlier. Unlike a full image file, which takes up as much actual space as the real disk it represents (regardless of the amount of unused space), a sparse image file (. sparseimage) takes up only as much actual disk space as the data contained within. This can be advantageous when backing up data. For example, assume a user would like to make a backup of a hard disk volume named \"INFO\" that is 5GB in size, yet only contains 2.5GB of actual data. While a single layer DVD-R (with around 4.7GB capacity) would be too small to store a full-sized \"INFO. dmg\" image file, an \"INFO. sparseimage\" image file will fit. This is because the unused 2.5GB from the original volume is not actually allocated within the sparse image file. The \"INFO. sparseimage\" file will occupy only 2.5GB. Note that if the 2.5GB \"INFO. sparseimage\" backup on the DVD is subsequently opened and mounted as a \"clone\" of the source volume, the Finder will report the clone as having the original 5GB capacity, with 2.5GB available, but the virtual disk will be \"read-only\", because the source image file resides on read-only media. However, the first-generation 2.5GB \"INFO. sparseimage\" on a hard drive, when mounted, may have files added to it until the originally designated 5GB capacity is reached. The \". sparseimage\" file will expand in size to accommodate the additional data. Deleting files from the mounted virtual volume will not result in a reduction in the size of the corresponding \". sparseimage\" file. However, the size of the image can be reduced when the volume is not mounted. Two limitations are therefore worth noting regarding the use of this image file format: A customized \". sparseimage\" image file can be assigned a larger total capacity than the physical volume (or HD partition) on which it originally resides. While the virtual volume will seem to make that capacity available, attempting to exceed the physical capacity of the underlying volume will result in a disk error: \"ran out of space\". The \". sparseimage\" file must first be moved to a larger physical disk or partition. As noted above, while mounted \". sparseimage\" image files automatically expand to their preassigned limit when data is added, they cannot be arbitrarily resized without the use of Disk Utility, hdiutil, or other such software. When the sparseimage file is not mounted, the . sparseimage file may be resized using Disk Utility\u2019s Resize Image function. Sparseimages may also be resized from the Terminal. The following example resizes a . sparseimage so that it can expand to a maximum size of 50 gigabytes: Similarly, a . sparseimage file that has expanded in size but then had files deleted, can be \"compacted\" to a smaller size with the following command: Additional information about the command may be seen by typing the following in the Terminal:" }},

It consists of a collection of conventions, and free and open software implementing those conventions. It is self-descriptive, cross-platform also termed platform or machine independent, documented, and administered by an international steering committee. It is also an American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics recommended practice. The CGNS project originated in 1994 as a joint effort between Boeing and NASA, and has since grown to include many other contributing organizations worldwide. In 1999, control of CGNS was completely transferred to a public forum known as the CGNS Steering Committee. This Committee is made up of international representatives from government and private industry. The CGNS system consists of two parts: (1) a standard format (known as Standard Interface Data Structure, or SIDS) for recording the data, and (2) software that reads, writes, and modifies data in that format. The format is a conceptual entity established by the documentation; the software is a physical product supplied to enable developers to access and produce data recorded in that format. The CGNS system is designed to facilitate the exchange of data between sites and applications, and to help stabilize the archiving of aerodynamic data. The data are stored in a compact, binary format and are accessible through a complete and extensible library of functions. The application programming interface (API) is cross-platform and can be easily implemented in C, C++, Fortran and Fortran 90 applications. A MEX interface mexCGNS also exists for calling the CGNS API in high-level programming languages MATLAB and GNU Octave. Object oriented interface CGNS++ and Python module pyCGNS exist, while they are not maintained. The principal target of CGNS is data normally associated with compressible viscous flow, but the standard is also applicable to subclasses such as Euler and potential flows. The CGNS standard includes the following types of data. Structured, unstructured, and hybrid grids Flow solution data, which may be nodal, cell-centered, face-centered, or edge-centered Multizone interface connectivity, both abutting and overset Boundary conditions Flow equation descriptions, including the equation of state, viscosity and thermal conductivity models, turbulence models, multi-species chemistry models, and electromagnetics Time-dependent flow, including moving and deforming grids Dimensional units and nondimensionalization information Reference states Convergence history Association to CAD geometry definitions User-defined data Much of the standard and the software is applicable to computational field physics in general. Disciplines other than fluid dynamics would need to augment the data definitions and storage conventions, but the fundamental database software, which provides platform independence, is not specific to fluid dynamics. CGNS is self-describing, allowing an application to interpret the structure and contents of a file without any outside information. CGNS can make use of either two different low-level data formats: an internally developed and supported method called Advanced Data Format (ADF), based on a common file format system previously in use at McDonnell Douglas HDF5, a widely used hierarchical data format" }},

An application can simply include a string of digits along with controls that identify a specific type of barcode, and the rendering of bars will be done on the output platform (physical printer hardware or software emulation). It supports Revisable Documents, which are editable like revisable-form DCA, Presentation Documents, which provide specific output formatting similar to DCA final-form, and Resource Documents, which hold control information such as fonts. A MO:DCA file consists of a sequential, ordered hierarchy of independent objects - documents, pages, data objects, and resource objects such as fonts and ICC profiles. Each object is delimited by begin/end structures, and objects to be rendered specify presentation parameters and resource requirements in structures called \"environment groups\". Since the pages in MO:DCA documents appear in sequential order, presentation can start as soon as the first page is received. Formats for specific objects are specified in OCAs (Object Content Architectures): PTOCA for Presentation and Text that has been formatted for output, GOCA for vector Graphics objects, IOCA for bitmapped Images and FOCA for Fonts.

This allows data to be serialized in a way that is often indistinguishable from traditional JSON. The basic idea of JSON-LD is to create a description of the data in the form of a \"context\" data structure. The context links object properties in a JSON document to concepts in an ontology. Furthermore, it allows any value to be coerced to a specified type or to be tagged with a language. A context can be embedded directly in a JSON-LD document or put into a separate file and referenced from different documents (from traditional JSON documents via an HTTP link header). These techniques allow most of the functionality of JSON-LD to be achieved without having to change the contents of existing documents and provide a smooth upgrade path for existing infrastructure." }} ] } }
